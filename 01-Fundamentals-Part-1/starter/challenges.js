/*Coding Challenge #1
Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is 
calculated using the formula:
BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg 
and height in meter).
Your tasks:
1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both 
versions)
3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about 
whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
Test data:
Â§ Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95 
m tall.
Â§ Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76
//For Data 2 just change values

const massMark = 78;
const heightMark = 1.69;

const massJohn = 92;
const heightJohn = 1.95;

const BMIMark = massMark / heightMark ** 2;
console.log(BMIMark);

const BMIJohn = massJohn / (heightJohn * heightJohn);
console.log(BMIJohn);

const markHigherBMI = BMIMark > BMIJohn;
console.log(markHigherBMI);//true


// Taking Decisions: if / else Statements
const age = 15;

if (age >= 18) {
  console.log('Sarah can start driving license ðŸš—');
} else {
  const yearsLeft = 18 - age;
  console.log(`Sarah is too young. Wait another ${yearsLeft} years :)`);
}

const birthYear = 2012;

let century;//HERE YOU DEFINE IT OUTSIDE CODEBLOCK
if (birthYear <= 2000) {
  century = 20;//CHANGE IT INSIDE
} else {
  century = 21;
}
console.log(century);
